## Switch Antigravity Plugin Root To Global Path

Change `plugin_root` in `scripts/hosts/antigravity/settings.toml` from `.agents/plugins/cairn` to the tilde literal `~/.gemini/config/plugins/cairn`, the form the host's own plugin guide writes the path, reword the comment above it (which now says the plugin loads relative to the consuming workspace), and rebuild the host trees so every rendered read path and `python3` command in `hosts/antigravity/` names the global path. `core/`, the dispatch prompts, and the agent files stay unchanged and the runner gets no resolution rule. Verified when `uv run scripts/build_hosts.py --check` passes on the committed trees and no file under `hosts/antigravity/` still carries `.agents/plugins/cairn`.

**Verified:**

- `plugin_root` in `scripts/hosts/antigravity/settings.toml` reads `"~/.gemini/config/plugins/cairn"`, the tilde literal.
- The comment above `plugin_root` no longer says the plugin loads relative to the consuming workspace; it describes the fixed global-install path in the host guide's tilde form.
- `uv run scripts/build_hosts.py` rebuilt the trees: every rendered read path and `python3` command in `hosts/antigravity/` (29 files, 92 references, agents included) names `~/.gemini/config/plugins/cairn`.
- `core/`, the Claude Code and Codex definitions and trees, the dispatch-prompt slots, and the agent sources are unchanged, and the runner gets no resolution rule.
- `uv run scripts/build_hosts.py --check` passes on the rebuilt trees.
- No file under `hosts/antigravity/` rendered from `core/` still carries `.agents/plugins/cairn`; the only remaining occurrences are in `hosts/antigravity/README.md`, rendered from the README template's install section, which the "Rewrite Antigravity Installation Section For Global Install" task rewrites.
