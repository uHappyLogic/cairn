## Remove Pinned Model From Agent Frontmatter

Delete the `model: opus` frontmatter line from each of the three files under `agents/` (`complete-task.md`, `recommend-open-question.md`, `answer-open-question-with-recommendation.md`) so a dispatched agent inherits the session's model instead of forcing Opus, leaving `name`, `description`, and `color` untouched. Verified when none of the three source agent files carries a `model` key and the regenerated `.agents/plugins/cairn/agents/` tree is byte-identical to the source.
